					<p>As part of their strategy to purify Germany on mostly racial grounds, many groups of different ethnicities, sexual orientation, and physical/mental capabilities were targeted by German authorities and, in many cases, killed en masse. This article on <strong>Nazi persecution</strong> against non-Jewish people includes information on Roma, the physically or mentally disabled, homosexuals, Soviet soldiers, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Poles.

					<h2 id="Roma_and_Sinti">Roma and Sinti</h2>
					<h3 id="Roma_and_Sinti_Background">Background</h3>
					<p>Roma and Sinti both belong to the same ethnic group, Romani, and are popularly called Gypsies. Both traditionally nomadic, the Sinti predominantly lived in Germany and Western Europe whereas the Roma predominantly lived in Austria and Eastern/Southern Europe.</p>
					<h3 id="Roma_and_Sinti_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>Both Nazis and non-Nazis considered the Roma and Sinti to be an inferior race. They were treated very similarly to how Jews were treated.</p>
					<h3 id="Roma_and_Sinti_History">History</h3>
					<p>On September 21, 1939, Reinhard Heydrick, head of the Reich Security Main Office, met with Security police and Security Service officials to discuss the deporation of 30,000 German and Austrian Roma from the Greater German Reich to the Generalgouvernment (occupied Poland). In the spring of 1940, Governor General Hans Frank prevented the deportation from happening at as large of a scale that was earlier proposed when he refused to allow large populations of Roma and Jews into the Generalgouvernement. The deportation ultimately happened from 1940 to 1941 with a much smaller number of Roma and Sinti, approximately 2,500. It is assumed that all or nearly all of those deported perished from gassing faciliteis or life in forced-labor camps.</p>
					<p>In autumn of 1941, police authorities deported 5,007 Gypsies from Austria to the Jewish ghetto in Lodz. Nearly half of them died within the first few months. With the intention to deport all Roma from the Greater German Reich, German authorities moved all Roma to "Gypsy camps."</p>
					<p>In 1940, all deportation of Roma was suspended, and so the Gypsy camps became long-term holding pens. Conditions in these camps were horrible, killing several hundreds of Roma.</p>
					<p>In December 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of all Roma, partially due to pressures from local police. Although Roma who were considered to be integrated into German society or came from families distinguished in the German military were exempt from the deportation order, local authorities typically ignored them, even rounding up Roma soldiers on leave.</p>
					<p>Roma were often deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and housed in a special compound called the Gypsy family camp. The Roma in this camp were subject to "medical" experimention from researchers.</p>
					<p>In late March, the SS murdered approximately 1,700 Roma from the already low population due to the spread of infectious disease.</p>
					<p>In May 1944, the leadership decided to murder the entirety of the camp by surrounding the compound with SS guards. When the Roma were ordered to come out, however, they refused and armed themselves. The SS leaders chose to withdraw and instead transferred those capable of labour to other concentration camps in Germany during the late spring and early summer of 1944. Immediately after, on August 2, the SS killed all of the remaining inmates (up to 5,000), most of which were the ill, elderly, women, and children.</p>
					<p>In other parts of German-occupied territories, restrictions and violence against Roma intensified. In the occupied Soviet Union region, German authorities shot male Roma from 1941 to early 1942, the French police interned 3,000-6,000 Roma from 1941-1942. In Romania, the military and police deported around 26,000 Roma from 1941 to 1942, thousands of which died from disease, starvation, and brutality. Finally, in Croatia, authorities nearly annihilated the entire Roma population, around 25,000 people. Croatian concentration camps themselves saw the deaths of 15,000-20,000 Roma.</p>
					<p>After the war, the Federal Republic of Germany claimed that all actions against Roma before 1943 were done to lcriminals. It was only until 1979 that the West German Federal Parliament identified the Nazi persecution of Roma as racially motivated, allowing the surviving Roma to apply for compensation. By this time, though, many of those who were eligible had already died.</p>
					<h3 id="Roma_and_Sinti_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>Of the 23,000 Roma sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, 19,000 died.</p>
					<p>In the Baltic States and other parts of the occupied Soviet Union, at least 30,000 Roma were shot by German military and SS units. In Serbia, it is currently unknown how many Roma were killed – estimates range from 1,000 to 12,000</p>
					<p>While the exact number of Roma killed during the Holocaust is unknown, historians estimate that the Germans (and their allies) killed around 25% of all European Roma or 250,000 out of 1,000,000 Roma.</p>

					</div>
					<h3 id="Mentally_and_Physically_Disabled_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Prosecution</h3>
					<p>Institutionalized patients with disabilities in Germany were systematically wiped out in order to "purify" Germany. Those targeted were deemed unworthy of life and a great genetic or financial burden on German society. 
					<h3 id="Mentally_and,Physically_Disabled_History">History</h3>
					<p>The "Child Euthanasia" program began in 1939 when a group of people led by the director of Hitler's private chancellery, Philipp Bouhler, and Hitler's attending physician, Karl Brandt. On August 18, 1939, the Reich Ministry of the Interior ordered physicians, nurses, etc. to report children under the age of three who showed signs of being physically or mentally disabled.</p>
					<p>In October 1939, the authorities began to recommend that parents of disabled children should admit their children into one of the specially designed pediatric clinics in Germany. These pediatric clinics were used by specially recruited medical staff to murder all the children admitted through lethal overdoses or starvation. Although the Child Euthanasia program initially only targeted infants and toddlers, they began to shift towards including anyone under the age of 17.</p>
					<p>In autumn of 1939, Hitler signed a secret authorization that protected physicians, medical staff, and administrators from prosecution for the murder of the disabled. This authorization was backdated to September 1, 1939 to make it appear like a wartime measure.</p>
					<p>As disabled adults began to be marked for murder, the new organization called T4 (short for Tiergartenstrasse 4, the office) created 6 gassing installations for adults. They were Brandenburg, near Berlin; Grafeneck, in southwestern Germany; Bernburg and Sonnenstein, in Saxony; Hartheim, in Austria; and Hadamar, in Hessen.</p>
					<p>Following similar tactics to those used in the Child Euthanasia program, T4 officials distributed questionnaries to anyone involved in medical care. The questionnaire was formatted to appear as though it was for the gathering of population data. The data was carefully pored over by well-reputed, secretly recruited German physicians and on January 1940, T4 began to transfer chosen patients to the six gassing centers. The victims were killed in gas chambers disguised as showers by carbon monoxide within hours after their arrival. Their bodies were then cremated and sent back to the families with a false cause and date of death.</p>
					<p>Despite the many measures that T4 took to conceal their activities, it soon became well-known among the public. There were many protests, including one made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemens_August_Graf_von_Galen" target="_blank">Clemens August Graf von Galen, bishop of Münster</a>, during a sermon on August 3, 1941. Due to public presure, Hitler shut down T4 in late August 1941.</p>
					<p>Despite Hitler's order to stop the program, the "euthanasia" continued. Child euthanasia resumed immediately after Hitler's declaration and adult euthanasia started up again in August 1942. This time, however, the entire process was much more concealed and less streamlined. Instead of gassing facilities, the new rate of murder was mostly dependent on local authorities due to the new methods of drug overdose and starvation.</p>
					<p>While the official euthanasia program was taking place in Germany and Austria, German-occupied territories saw similar "euthanasia" efforts. These efforts were less for the sake of German purity and more for the sake of killing those who were deemed unworthy of life. In Poland and the Soviet Union, SS and police forces (not medical professionals) killed the disabled with shootings and gas vans.</p>
					<p>Later on, during the implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution" target="_blank">Final Solution</a>, many of the same gassing facilities used by T4 were repurposed and many of the T4 personnel were given positions in the various killing centers.</p>
					<h3 id="Mentally_and_Physically_Disabled_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>During the child-only phase of the program, it is estimated that at least 5,000 mentally or physically disabled German children were killed.</p>
					<p>During the first phase of T4, before Hitler shut it down, internal calculations placed the number of murders at 70,273 between January 1940 and August 1941.</p>
					<p>It is estimated that in total, Nazi Germany had killed approximately 250,000 disabled individuals within the Reich.</p>
					<p>Outside of the Reich, it is estimated that SS and police forces murdered approximately 30,000 disabled by autumn of 1931 in Pomerania, West Prussia, and Poland.</p>

					<h2 id="Poles">Poles</h2>
					<h3 id="Poles_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>The Nazis considered Poles to be an inferior race and sought to reduce them to a leaderless labour class.</p>
					<h3 id="Poles_History">History</h3>
					<p>In September 1939, the German sterrorized the Polish nation in order to destory its culture and reudce the Poles to a subservient race. Thousands of Polish nobility, clergy and intellectuals were all shot, removing the "leadership class" and rendering the Poles incapable of resisting German rule.</p>
					<p>Hitler also plannedto "Germanize" Poland by replacing the Poles with Germans. In 1942-43, approximately 100,000 Polish civilians (30,000 children) were removed from Poland.</p>
					<p>Although the Nazis were keen to get rid of the Poles, the Nazis still needed them for labour. As a result, Police would grav Poles off streets, trains, and other public areas in order to fill quotas.</p>
					<p>In August 1944, an underground Polish government led by Wladyslaw Sikorski coordinated a violent uprising against the Germans in Warsaw that lasted two months. Eventually though, they were crushed by the Germans and more than 200,000 Poles had been killed. 
					<h3 id="Poles_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>Between 1939 and 1945 at least 1.5 million Polish citizens were deported to Germany as free labour.</p>
					<p>It is currently estimated that the Germans killed between 1.8 and 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish citizens and 3 million Jewish Polish citizens.</p>

					<h2 id="Soviet_Soldiers">Soviet Soldiers</h2>
					<h3 id="Soviet_Soldiers_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>Not only did the Nazis see Soviet POWs as racially inferior, but also as potential obstacles in the German quest for lebensraum. The Nazi regime claimed that they were not obligated to care for any Soviet prisoners of war because the Soviet Union had not ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention of Prisoners of War or specifically declared its commitment to the 1907 Hague Convention on the Rules of War. Despite its truth, they were still obligated by the general international law of war to protect prisoners.</p>
					<h3 id="Soviet_Soldiers_History">History</h3>
					<p>In August 1941, the German army set a ration of 2,200 calories per day for working Soviet POWs, though the reality was that they only received around 700 calories a day. Within a few weeks, those on the "subsistence" program had starved to death.</p>
					<p>The Germans put very little effort into providing shelter for their Soviet POWs. Despite establishment of makeshift camps later on, the prisoners still oftentimes dug holes in the ground as shelters. By the end of 1941, many epidemics rose to the top as the main cause of death. In October 1941, almost 5,000 Soviet POWs died everyday.</p>
					<p>Many of the prisoners captured in 1941 were marched across hundreds of miles and shot to death when too exhausted to continue.</p>
					<p>German forces oftentimes shot severely wounded Soviet soldiers to rid themselves of a potential resource expenditures. Anyone who was caught trying to escape was shot immediately. Additionally, a decree saying that the use of arms against Soviet POWs was legal on September 8, 1941 was a clear invitation to officers to kill as many Soviet POWs as they wanted.</p>
					<p>In the middle of July 1941, General Hermann Reinecke allowed security forces under the Reich Security Main Office to screen Soviet POWs for politically and racially intolerable elements. Those who did show signs of intolerable elements were transferred to the SS and killed. These executions often took place in concentration camps. For example, the SS killed 65,000+ Soviet POWs over a period of six months by feeding them only grass and water. In Flossenburg, the SS burned Soviet POWs to death. In Majdanek, Soviets were shot in trenches. In Mauthausen, the blood from shot POWs contaminated the local water supply.</p>
					<p>A few camps (Auschwitz-Brikenau and Majdanek) were originally made for Soviet POWs, but January 1942 saw only a few hundred out of 10,000 Soviet POWs arrive alive. In the following, Himmler decided to fill the camps with 150,000 Jews. It was also at this time that Rudolf Hoess refined their method of execution by hydrogen cyanide.</p>
					<h3 id="Soviet_Soldiers_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>According to army reports, anywhere between 25% to 70% of Soviet soldiers died during the transit from occupied countries to Germany.</p>
					<p>The number of official executions in concentration camps ranges from 140,000 to 500,000.</p>
					<p>By February 1942, 2,000,000 out of 3,300,000 Soviet POWs in Germany had died from starvation, exposure to the elements, disease, or shooting.</p>

					<h2 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</h2>
					<h3 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>The Nazis intensely persecuted Jehovah's Witnesses because the Witnesses would not accept the authority of the state. This unqillingness to conform came from their international connections, their strong opposition to war on behalf of a non-religious government, and strong opposition to the interference of organized governments in anything relating to one's conscience. Specifically, this appeared as a refusal to give the Nazi salute, join party organizations/let their children join the Hitler Youth, participate in elections, and hang Nazi flags.</p>
					<p>The Nazi suspicion of Jehovah's Witnesses grew to the point where Gestapo agents infiltrated Bible study meetings, a special unit of the Gestapo was dedicated to compiling a registry of all Jehovah's Witnesses, and attempting to ban the distribution of their printed materials.</p>
					<h3 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses_History">History</h3>
					<p>Very soon after the Nazi takeover, many regional governments began to aggressively push against Jehovah's Witness by breaking up their meetings and ransacking then occupying their local offices. On April 1, 1935, the Reich ordered local officials to dissolve the Watchtower Society (organization led by Jehovah's Witnesses)</p>
					<p>When Germany reinstated compulsory military service in March 1935, conflict with the Witnesses escalated due to the illegal refusal to be drafted or perform military work. Increasingly, more and more Jehovah's Witnesses were arrested, tried, then sent to prisons and concentration camps. Despite being sent to concentration camps by the thousands and singled out with purple triangular patches, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to meet, pray, and recruit.</p>
					<p>Despite the harsh conditions of Nazi concentration camps, Jehovah's Witnesses were sustained by a strong network of support among each other and the belief that their suffering was for God and managed to maintain their refusal to carry out military-like activities such as roll coll or rolling bandages for soldiers. At the same time, Nazi officers trusted and often used the Witnesses as servants because they refused to escape or resort to physically attacking their guards.</p>
					<h3 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>By 1939, there were approximately 6,000 Witnesses detained in prisons or camps. The rest either fled Germany, continued their religious observance secretively, or left the religion altogether.</p>
					<p>In 1933, there were 25,000 to 30,000 German Jehovah's Witnesses. Of them, an estimated 20,000 stayed active throughout the whole period. About half of the active Witnesses were at one time convicted and sentenced. At least 3,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were sentenced to concentration camps, including 200-250 Dutch, 200 Austrians, 100 Poles, and between 10-50 Belgians, French, Czechs, and Hungarians.</p>
					<p>Of all the prosecuted Jehovah's Witnesses, approximately 1,000 German Jehovah's Witnesses, 90 Austrians, 120 Dutch Witnesses, and 190 Witnesses from other countries died during their time in camps and prisons. Additionally, there were at least 273 executions concerning Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>

					<h2 id="Homosexuals">Homosexuals</h2>
					<h3 id="Homosexuals_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>Homosexual men were considered a danger to Nazi policies meant to raise German birthrates. Due to that reason, lesbians and non-German homosexuals were usually not targeted for persecution. In fact, Nazi leaders were quite willing to accept non-German or female homosexuals into their community so long as they controlled their "deviant" behaviour and conformed to racial ideals.</p>
					<h3 id="Homosexuals_History">History</h3>
					<p>During the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic">Weimar Republic</a> (1918-1933), German homosexual-rights activists fluorished as they had never done before. When the Nazi party took over, however, they regarded the past toleration of homosexuality as a sign of decadence and a corrupting influence on German values and culture. Very early on, the Nazi party began a campaign to eliminate homosexuality that was directed by the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> (SS) leader, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>.</p>
					<p>On May 6, 1933, students led by the SA (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>/Storm Troopers) ransacted the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin and confiscated its library. Within four days, most of the collection of over 12,000 books and 35,000 irreplaceable pictures was destroyed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings">book burning</a> in Berlin's city center. This was the first of many steps towards completely wiping out an openly homosexual culture from Germany. Police closed bars and clubs that catered specifically towards homosexuals and publications. The primary goal during this stage was to destroy all networks of support for homosexuals.</p>
					<p>In 1934, the Gestapo ordered local police forces to maintain lists of all men engaging in gay activities. As it turned out, many of these local police offices had laready been keeping track of gay men for many years. With the rapid influx of data, Nazi officials hunted down individual homosexuals during police actions. </p>
					<p>On June 28, 1935, the Ministry of Justice revised <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175">Paragraph 175</a> (section of the German Criminal Code that made illegal homosexuality between males) to provide a legal basis for extending Nazi persecution of homosexuals and expanded the category of criminally indecent acts to anything that appeared gay. Later, it was ruled that the intention or contemplation of commiting an act of homosexuality fit under the earlier requisites for arrest.</p>
					<p>On October 26, 1936, Heinrich Himmler formed a sub-branch of the Security Police called the Reich Central Office for Combating Homosexuality and Abortion. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albert_Meisinger">Josef Meisinger</a> was the director of the new office. This office held powers to preemptively arrest anyone deemed dangerous to Germany's moral fiber. Oftentimes, the police would re-arrest or send those who were recently released from prison to concentration camps</p>
					<p>On April 4, 1938, the Gestapo announced that men convicted of homosexuality could be sent to concentration camps immediately after fulfilling their sentences. The practice of sending gay men to concentration camps wasn't new, however, as this was already being done immediately after the Nazi's seizure of power in January 1933. As a tangential point, Nazi officials often miscategorized political prisoners as homosexuals and were marked by pink triangles. According to firsthand accounts, homosexuals faced the worst treatment in the camps</p>
					<p>Some Nazi officials designed policies to "cure" homosexuals of their disease" through hard work and humiliation. Guards often isolated homosexual prisoners and would beat them on arrival. One of these "cures" included castration. In the early stages of castration as a cure for homosexuality, gay defendants could agree to be castrated in return for lower sentences. Later on, judges and SS officials would be given the power to order the castration of any gay prisoner without their consent. Nazis were also very interested in medical experimentation during this time, and so allowed homosexual inmates to be experimented on. These "scientific" endeavours did not yield any useful results.</p> 
					<h3 id="Homosexuals_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>It is estimated that 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals between the years 1933 and 1945. Of these arrests, approximately 50,000 men were arrested under <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175">Paragraph 175</a> and 5000 to 15000 of those prisoners were sent to concentration camps. Although there are no known statistics for the death rate of homosexuals in German concentration camps, experts place it at 65%.</p>
