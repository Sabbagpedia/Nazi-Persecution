					<h3 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>The Nazis intensely persecuted Jehovah's Witnesses because the Witnesses would not accept the authority of the state. This unqillingness to conform came from their international connections, their strong opposition to war on behalf of a non-religious government, and strong opposition to the interference of organized governments in anything relating to one's conscience. Specifically, this appeared as a refusal to give the Nazi salute, join party organizations/let their children join the Hitler Youth, participate in elections, and hang Nazi flags.</p>
					<p>The Nazi suspicion of Jehovah's Witnesses grew to the point where Gestapo agents infiltrated Bible study meetings, a special unit of the Gestapo was dedicated to compiling a registry of all Jehovah's Witnesses, and attempting to ban the distribution of their printed materials.</p>
					<h3 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses_History">History</h3>
					<p>Very soon after the Nazi takeover, many regional governments began to aggressively push against Jehovah's Witness by breaking up their meetings and ransacking then occupying their local offices. On April 1, 1935, the Reich ordered local officials to dissolve the Watchtower Society (organization led by Jehovah's Witnesses)</p>
					<p>When Germany reinstated compulsory military service in March 1935, conflict with the Witnesses escalated due to the illegal refusal to be drafted or perform military work. Increasingly, more and more Jehovah's Witnesses were arrested, tried, then sent to prisons and concentration camps. Despite being sent to concentration camps by the thousands and singled out with purple triangular patches, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to meet, pray, and recruit.</p>
					<p>Despite the harsh conditions of Nazi concentration camps, Jehovah's Witnesses were sustained by a strong network of support among each other and the belief that their suffering was for God and managed to maintain their refusal to carry out military-like activities such as roll coll or rolling bandages for soldiers. At the same time, Nazi officers trusted and often used the Witnesses as servants because they refused to escape or resort to physically attacking their guards.</p>
					<h3 id="Jehovah's_Witnesses_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>By 1939, there were approximately 6,000 Witnesses detained in prisons or camps. The rest either fled Germany, continued their religious observance secretively, or left the religion altogether.</p>
					<p>In 1933, there were 25,000 to 30,000 German Jehovah's Witnesses. Of them, an estimated 20,000 stayed active throughout the whole period. About half of the active Witnesses were at one time convicted and sentenced. At least 3,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were sentenced to concentration camps, including 200-250 Dutch, 200 Austrians, 100 Poles, and between 10-50 Belgians, French, Czechs, and Hungarians.</p>
					<p>Of all the prosecuted Jehovah's Witnesses, approximately 1,000 German Jehovah's Witnesses, 90 Austrians, 120 Dutch Witnesses, and 190 Witnesses from other countries died during their time in camps and prisons. Additionally, there were at least 273 executions concerning Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>

					<h2 id="Homosexuals">Homosexuals</h2>
					<h3 id="Homosexuals_Reasons_for_Persecution">Reasons for Persecution</h3>
					<p>Homosexual men were considered a danger to Nazi policies meant to raise German birthrates. Due to that reason, lesbians and non-German homosexuals were usually not targeted for persecution. In fact, Nazi leaders were quite willing to accept non-German or female homosexuals into their community so long as they controlled their "deviant" behaviour and conformed to racial ideals.</p>
					<h3 id="Homosexuals_History">History</h3>
					<p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic">Weimar Republic</a> (1918-1933), German homosexual-rights activists fluorished as they had never done before. When the Nazi party took over, however, they regarded the past toleration of homosexuality as a sign of decadence and a corrupting influence on German values and culture. Very early on, the Nazi party began a campaign to eliminate homosexuality that was directed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> (SS) leader, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>.</p>
					<p>On May 6, 1933, students led by the SA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>/Storm Troopers) ransacted the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin and confiscated its library. Within four days, most of the collection of over 12,000 books and 35,000 irreplaceable pictures was destroyed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings">book burning</a> in Berlin's city center. This was the first of many steps towards completely wiping out an openly homosexual culture from Germany. Police closed bars and clubs that catered specifically towards homosexuals and publications. The primary goal during this stage was to destroy all networks of support for homosexuals.</p>
					<p>In 1934, the Gestapo ordered local police forces to maintain lists of all men engaging in gay activities. As it turned out, many of these local police offices had laready been keeping track of gay men for many years. With the rapid influx of data, Nazi officials hunted down individual homosexuals during police actions. </p>
					<p>On June 28, 1935, the Ministry of Justice revised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175">Paragraph 175</a> (section of the German Criminal Code that made illegal homosexuality between males) to provide a legal basis for extending Nazi persecution of homosexuals and expanded the category of criminally indecent acts to anything that appeared gay. Later, it was ruled that the intention or contemplation of commiting an act of homosexuality fit under the earlier requisites for arrest.</p>
					<p>On October 26, 1936, Heinrich Himmler formed a sub-branch of the Security Police called the Reich Central Office for Combating Homosexuality and Abortion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albert_Meisinger">Josef Meisinger</a> was the director of the new office. This office held powers to preemptively arrest anyone deemed dangerous to Germany's moral fiber. Oftentimes, the police would re-arrest or send those who were recently released from prison to concentration camps</p>
					<p>On April 4, 1938, the Gestapo announced that men convicted of homosexuality could be sent to concentration camps immediately after fulfilling their sentences. The practice of sending gay men to concentration camps wasn't new, however, as this was already being done immediately after the Nazi's seizure of power in January 1933. As a tangential point, Nazi officials often miscategorized political prisoners as homosexuals and were marked by pink triangles. According to firsthand accounts, homosexuals faced the worst treatment in the camps</p>
					<p>Some Nazi officials designed policies to "cure" homosexuals of their disease" through hard work and humiliation. Guards often isolated homosexual prisoners and would beat them on arrival. One of these "cures" included castration. In the early stages of castration as a cure for homosexuality, gay defendants could agree to be castrated in return for lower sentences. Later on, judges and SS officials would be given the power to order the castration of any gay prisoner without their consent. Nazis were also very interested in medical experimentation during this time, and so allowed homosexual inmates to be experimented on. These "scientific" endeavours did not yield any useful results.</p> 
					<h3 id="Homosexuals_Statistics">Statistics</h3>
					<p>It is estimated that 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals between the years 1933 and 1945. Of these arrests, approximately 50,000 men were arrested under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175">Paragraph 175</a> and 5000 to 15000 of those prisoners were sent to concentration camps. Although there are no known statistics for the death rate of homosexuals in German concentration camps, experts place it at 65%.</p>
